### What I learned

After finishing [my first project](https://tripus.me), I realized I was giving every single element a height and a width. I've since learned not to manually control each element's sizing. In this challenge, I tried to have the parent element and the element itself determine its height and width. I mostly stuck to padding, margin, and flexbox to position elements. I wouldn't say I've mastered CSS sizing, but I do think this effort will help me get there eventually.
